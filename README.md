## Features

1. Clickable Board: Click on the 'üü•' (representing possible moves) to make a move, notice that your moves are recorded as ASCII text in the bottom bar.

2. Replay Game: With a loaded game in the 'Game Data' section, press the 'Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è' button to play the game with an animation. Use slider to control speed.

3. Customizable Icons: The '‚ùå' and '‚≠ï' buttons can be replaced with any character (especially emojis üíÉ). This character will be used to mark your moves.

## Character mapping

The game data represents the sequence of actions taken using a unique ASCII character per cell. The order of the characters represents the order of the moves taken.

Characters used:

```
!"#$%&'()\*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^\_`abcdefghijklmnop
```

Mapping from the game board to an integer [0,80] or ASCII character encoding:

```python
# Get index value for individual cell
index = cell.column + 9 * cell.row

# Generate list of characters
chars = [chr(i + 32) for i in range(81)]

# Decode characters -> numbers
nums = [ord(char) - 32 for char in chars]
```

## Tournament mode

The text field is the input for how many games to display at a time. For best results, input 1, 2, 3, 4 or 8 only. After inputting, click the run button to show the games.
